In the second hour we discuss anti-whiteness, the holocaust narrative and end the show with a Richard Spencer impression contest.

As their narrative crumbles and Moore remains resilient, actual photographic evidence emerges against one of their own, forcing an awkward double standard to which many in a once-unified Democrat Party refuse to subscribe.

While Ralph Northam's defeat of Ed Gillespie dealt another blow to a dying GOPe, it came with a high price. Rural Whites stayed home and the Coalition of the Ascendant didn't, so the once vaunted capital of the Confederacy is filled with trannies and anti-gun nuts. Fighting back, the establishment has set its sights on the destruction of Roy Moore in Alabama, attempting a redux of the Access Hollywood tape that failed to stop Trump little more than a year earlier. With Moore refusing to back down, the stage has been set for a Senate seat showdown. From electoral politics to the Podesta Group and from Fusion GPS to Donna Brazile, the establishment keeps coming up SNAKE EYES.","http://traffic.libsyn.com/fash-the-nation/FTN_111117.mp3",NULL,NULL,NULL,

This is a world class episode of Exodus Americanus. You may not agree, but for all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake when you put your faith in Walrus and Roscoe.","https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/exodusamericanus/exo_179_final_cut.mp3",NULL,NULL,NULL,"show number and date out of order"

BREAKING: One seriously important instance of meme magick which occurred after the recording of this episode was Mike Lindell, creator and founder of MyPillow™, endorsing Donald Trump. MyPillow is the most comfortable pillow you'll ever use, and it's made entirely in the USA by White people. With his support, we can rest easy knowing the God Emperor will ascend to the throne as planned. Praise Kek!",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,

Little is known about Hamilton's early life, which is odd considering his prominent role framer of the U.S. Constitution, first Secretary of the Treasury, creator of the nation's first national bank, the architect of the inherently corrupt system of debt-financed capitalism we are saddled with today, chief author of The Federalist Papers, master of media manipulation, election meddler, and almost but never actually President of the United States. Rest assured, we thoroughly smash that early life in order to fully understand the identity of the man himself; who he is, where he comes from, what shaped his worldview, and ultimately, in turn, how he shaped the world itself.

It's best understood as a replacement religion—one that is flourishing in our putatively secular age. Traditional religions succeeded in making populations more evolutionarily adaptive: more fertile, cooperative, and willing to outcompete others, all of which are conceived as the will of the gods. SJWism, by contrast, is a ""death cult"" that aims to lose. Among other effects, the rise of the SJW marks the return of heresy as a religious and political concept, as well as the dolling out of quasi-death sentences to those who think ""evil"" thoughts. One cannot understand current controversies around social-media ""de-platforming"" and ""cancel culture"" without inquiring into the evolutionary origins of the SJW religion, which undergirds and legitimizes these phenomena. In the end, the West's collapse into ""Clown World"" is due to the impact of industrialization on the human environment and the end of Darwinian selection. One surprising result is the birth of a new intolerant religion, which shares much in common with monotheism, but has dispensed with God. https://nationalpolicy.institute/2020/03/26/the-return-of-heresy/","https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/26226680/religious_origins_of_sjws.mp3",NULL,NULL,"2528.00",NULL

How altruism literally will get you killed as a young lady just showed us, by acting as an expert on human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. People crying about the Swedish government sending home 20 Afghani Beard Babies. We discuss how our feminist government wants to stop racial strangers from starring at women, by implementing some feminist city planning. Statistics show that deadly violence in Sweden is on the decrease, so we can breathe out and relax while 18 women are getting raped every single day. Resistance News: We deal with the Jewish outcry at people putting our stickers on their windows and them blowing it all out of proportion. Now they are asking for a clamp down on anti-Semitism and for new fancy locales to be allocated for their tribe. We discuss a recent activity done by the Finnish branch of the movement, where they with flyers and speeches pointed out the hypocrisy of the Finnish police. We mention the Hero of the week and the Aryan ""Chutzpah"" he demonstrated when he removed Lügenpresse from the premises.

The reality is harsh. White minorities do not and will not fare well in such environments to begin with, especially with the constant anti-white resentments being stoked by the media, political, and academic mouthpieces of the globalist elite.   Jessica writes:  I can’t help but laugh when I hear Remainers pointificate about how us Brexit voters are all ignorant, naïve, parochial, racist, backward, xenophobic etc...etc...etc... little-Englanders. There are very few people who can use the term #globalcitizen or citizen-of-the-world as much as me.  And the term is nonsense. It’s the multiculturalists, with their ‘more that unites us than divides us’ religious mantras, who are the naïve ones, who don’t understand the world. I was raised in seven countries – the UK, Botswana, Zimbabwe, France, Switzerland, America, Turkey – by front-line humanitarian aid workers. My childhood was an endlessly changing kaleidoscope of cultures, creeds, colours and classes, more diverse than even the most ardent, diversity-junkies can imagine.  It left me without roots, culture, identity or country, an endless immigrant from nowhere and to nowhere.   It was this experience that fuelled much of my desire to vote leave, to protect future generations from the atomised nothingness that constant cultural change causes. Raising children amid endless change and cultural relativism is damaging, if not abusive. People yearn to be rooted.   Remainers say the people who voted out, who’ve lived amid radically different, often hostile cultures, suffered at the hands of them - the serious human rights crisis that is rape gang epidemic? - who've have seen their communities colonised by them are the ones who are parochial. For many Remainers ideology trumps reality – they hold on to the idea that this will all end in a multicultural Kumbaya-round-the-campfire with fundamentalist religious zeal. They remain largely immune from the worst consequences of mass migration and entirely unaware that many multicultural societies are not places to copy.  -Listen to hear more!","https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/19271972/the_cocktail_hour_ep_55_the_delusions_of_multi_culturalism.mp3",NULL,NULL,"8289.00",NULL
